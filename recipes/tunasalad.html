        <h4>tuna salad the negro version</h4>
        <p>When I was a kid, I remember seeing my granny making her tuna salad
            and me looking at her in digust as she put it in her mouth to taste.
            I was a very picky eater so everything that my granny ate was nasty to me
            before I even try it.</p>
        <p>I got to the age of 25 when I actually tried tuna salad. I did one of those
            squidward bites, and just like squidward, I loved it. I learned how to make her
            recipe and ever since it has been one of my favorite sides to make.</p>

        <p>So I bring forth to you my tuna salad and a few other recipes that I have perfected
            and you will enjoy.</p>
        
        <h2>Here's the list of ingredients I use</h2>

        <p>I am a bit extra with my ingredients, I let my ancestors tell me when I have enough
             so use as much or little as you want</p>

        <ul>
            <li>16 oz elbow macaroni noodles</li>
            <li>2-3 small cans of tuna</li>
            <li>4-6 hard boiled eggs</li>
            <li>3-5 tablespoons of pickle relish. I buy sweet salad cubes</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of mayo (your choice brand I prefer dukes)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of mustard</li>
            <li>salt and pepper </li>
            <li>I put garlic powder and paprika as well but it is entirely optional what other seasonings you use</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Steps to creating this wonderful tuna salad</h2>
        

        <ol>
            <li>boil the macaroni noodles in a large pot of water until they are soft enough to your liking</li>
            <li>While the macaroni is boiling, boil the eggs. According to google, it takes around 6-12 minutes to boil that many eggs</li>
            <li>When the noodles are done, strain them and put them in a large bowl or container and let it cool for a few minutes</li>
            <li>Peel  the hard boiled eggs and cut them in small cubes. The size depends on how big you cut them to your liking</li>
            <li>Add all the other ingredients to the container and stir it all together.</li>
            <li>Put in the refigerator for at least 30 minutes to cool and serve.</li>
    </ol>
